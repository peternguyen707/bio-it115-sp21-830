Hi, my name is Peter Nguyen! I’m enrolled at Seattle Central College through the Year Up program, which gives me the opportunity <br>
to pursue my career goals in software development. And at this program, I also learn professionalism and soft skills, <br>
leading into a 6 month internship at one of Year Up’s corporate partners. My goal is to get a career in software development <br>
that will let me nurture the skills I learn through Year Up.
