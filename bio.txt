Hi, my name is Peter Nguyen! I’m enrolled at Seattle Central College through the Year Up program, which gives me the opportunity
to pursue my career goals in software development. And at this program, I also learn professionalism and soft skills, 
leading into a 6 month internship at one of Year Up’s corporate partners. My goal is to get a career in software development
that will let me nurture the skills I learn through Year Up.
